			<p>In an time when marketing behaves behaves like a

And that will continue to define it long after its’ media lifespan&#8199has&#8199passed.<br>For brands that organize themselves around the principles of craftsmanship and the art of the well made this is an opportunity.

			<h4>You need to direct a marriage between art and commerce.</h4>
			<p>Consider Pope Julius II, Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel.
				When Pope Julius ll commissioned Michelangelo’s work in 1508 
				he had two goals: First, to glorify the religion he was in charge of spreading. And the second, to consolidate papal power 
				through a show of splendor and vision.

				 Michelangelo’s motivations were a little simpler. 
				Money. And you didn't say no to the Pope. 

				Together, they pushed each other, prodded each other and 
				took each other out of their respective comfort zones.

				The end result? 5 million people visit the Sistine Chapel every year. The patron and artist achieved immortality. And the work they created together is as powerful and resonant now as it was in 1512.

				Marrying art and commerce isn't easy. It isn't for everyone or every product. But for brands that place a premium on being highly valued, it’s a methodology that has withstood the test of time. And the test of time is something we need to look at today in a new light.</p>
